# 0x15. C - File I/O

## This is readme file for File descriptors, done by Oludare Zenos Opeyemi.

File descriptors can also refer to other objects that do not normally exist in the file system, such as anonymous pipes and network sockets. The FILE data structure in the C standard I/O library usually includes a low level file descriptor for the object in question on Unix-like systems.
On a Unix-like operating system, the first three file descriptors, by default, are STDIN (standard input), STDOUT (standard output), and STDERR (standard error).
